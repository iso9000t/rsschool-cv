##### **Summary**
After gaining valuable experience in the financial industry and accounting, I have decided to pursue a career that allows me to tap into my creative potential. My past hobbies and experiences in audio production and photography have prepared me for a career in video editing, compositing, and motion design. I have a track record of creating popular videos on YouTube and have mastered a variety of software along the way. My skills also include scriptwriting, editing, sound design, 3D animation, and rendering. Recently, I have begun learning front-end development and am excited about the endless possibilities it presents. From creating intuitive and user-friendly websites to bringing ideas to life with interactive design, the potential of front-end development and related fields is truly limitless. I am confident that my previous experiences and self-motivation make me a strong candidate for this field.
